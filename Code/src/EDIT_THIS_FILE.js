In high school, I graduated as a straight-A IB student while leading the STEAM Club, captaining the swim team, and working with Miami WaterKeeper on local conservation projects. Now at Pomona, I’m continuing to explore environmental issues through research, advocacy, and hands-on community work. Outside of academics, I love scuba diving, running, and staying connected to nature. Thanks for visiting my portfolio!",
